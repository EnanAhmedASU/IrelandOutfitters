During this sprint I completed the following. 
I updated resources page with available pictures from national parks and fix alignment based on sponsor feedback. During a previous sprint, I presented some design options to the sponsor for feedback. 
Changes to the Rent Equipment banner were rejected, but it was decided that adding images to the national park information page would helpful to customers. I added these elements to the site.

I removed inaccurate terminology from home page and other site locations, i.e. payment claims leftover from initial site design. During the course of this project, mutliple placeholder elements were
added to the site to accomodate future development as more details were made available. Some of these elements were deemed unnecessary, but maintenance was not completed to remove them.

I upscaled logo to fix minor display issues. Using online tools, I converted the logo png to an svg to improve the sponsor's ability to use the logo in a variety of applications. 

I fixed broken links found in national parks resources and investigate other broken links across site. During maintenance and testing, a few broken links were found that inspired a site-wide investigation.
I went through the site and ensure no broken links remained.
