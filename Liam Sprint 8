During this sprint, I focused primarily on aesthetic changes

Updating the logo to a better shade of green and fixed some initial export issues. This logo can be easily seen on the site as proof of completion.
Additionally, this logo was also implemented as the site favicon, which can be seen easily as well.
Incorporating this logo into the site represented another accomplishment during this sprint.

Additionally, the sponsor reached out with a website called UpSplash to potentially add addtional images to the site.
I investigated this website and added a few sample images in spots, primarily the resources page and as banners in the shop section.
The sponsor reported that the current design of the site is sufficient and a large incorporation of these images is not necessary.
However, some images on the resource page were appreciated and further investigation will be performed to update the site accordingly.
