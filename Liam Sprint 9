In the lead up to this sprint, the sponsor reported multiple issues with the site. Rather than developing new features, I focused on addressing issues in the site currently.

The first issue spotted was a handful of broken links. I fixed this issue and also began investigating additional areas of the website for more according to our test plan.
Additionally, the site language was inconsistent and needed to be changed. Specifically, the sponsor desired all mentions of "shop" to be changed to "rent equipment".
I completed this task and looked for additional inconsistencies in wording across the site, only fixing a few minor errors.

Because of the issues found in the site, I began to perform additional testing (not for validation) to ensure that the final validation run operates as desired.
Some changes I made during this included minor wording fixes and button issues, but overall no major breaks were detected in testing. There remain features left to implement, however.
